# Quadify

Quadify is a comprehensive toolkit and plugin for integrating advanced audio display and control hardware with your Raspberry Pi audio system. Designed for use with Volumio, Quadify brings new life to classic Quad FM4 tuners and other devices, adding modern features such as OLED displays, rotary encoders, buttons, and LEDs.

## Overview

Originally inspired by work from Audiophonics, Quadify has been extensively enhanced by the open-source community.
This repository contains everything you need to add display, button, and rotary encoder support to your Pi-based audio system.

**Features:**

* OLED display integration (various types supported)
* Button and LED input/output
* Rotary encoder support
* Modular hardware configuration
* Easy install scripts

## Supported Systems

Quadify is designed and tested for **Volumio** (Raspberry Pi OS).
Other Pi-based audio distributions may work, but are not officially supported.

Supported features include:

* OLED display installation
* Button and LED integration
* Rotary encoder installation

## Important Notes

* **Stable Release:** This is the main Quadify repository. For the latest features or experimental work, check for a `beta` branch.
* **Back up your data first!**
* An **active internet connection** is required for installation (to fetch dependencies).
* Standard Volumio settings are preserved, but you may need to use the Volumio Web UI for some system or audio settings.

## Debugging and Service Management

If Quadify isn’t working as expected, try these steps:

**Restart Quadify service:**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart quadify
```

**Run Quadify manually for logs:**

```bash
cd Quadify/src
python3 main.py
```

**View Quadify logs:**

```bash
journalctl -u quadify -f
```

**View Volumio logs:**

```bash
journalctl -u volumio -f
```

**Check CAVA status (for VU Meter mode):**

```bash
sudo systemctl status cava
```
